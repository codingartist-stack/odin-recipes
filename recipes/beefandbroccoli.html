<h4>Instructions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Take big chunk of fat from beef and slice into ¼ inch thin. In a mixing bowl, add sliced beef and rest of ingredients for beef. Mix well with your hand, set aside</li>
        <li>While beef is marinate, let’s make sauce and prepare vegetables. In another mixing bowl, combine all ingredients for brown sauce. Whisk well, set aside</li>
        <li>Cut dry bottom from broccolini and cut into halves, or bite sizes, set aside.</li>
        <li>Chop garlic and green onion. Mince fresh ginger and set aside</li>
        <li>Heat a wok over high heat with approximately 1 cup water and bring it to boil. Add broccolini and blench for 1 minutes. Remove from heat and drain broccoli and set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat now-empty wok over high heat until completely dried; add oil and swirl to coat. Add garlic and ginger, stir fry until you can smell the fragrance, about 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Add marinated beef into wok, combine with garlic and ginger. Spread beef evenly bottom of work, and cook until edge is darken and crispy, about a couple minutes.</li>
        <li>Turn it over, and cook other side for a couple minutes or until edge is darken, crispy and beef is cooked ¾ way and you can barely see red spots</li>
        <li>Pour sauce we made earlier; stir fry until sauce has thicken, glossy and beef is coated evenly with sauce, about a minute. Stir frequently so sauce will not burn.</li>
        <li>Add blanched broccolini into beef and combine well, about 30 seconds. We don’t need to cook broccolini, just need to mixed with sauce and reheated.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat, stir in chopped green onion and sesame oil.</li>
        <li>Transfer to a serving plate, and garnish with some toasted sesame seeds if you desired. Serve with warm cooked Jasmine rice is the best!!</li>
