recipes project 

I wanted this first project to look nicer, but I soon realized what I wanted to do was beyond my current skill set. I could have done some inline CSS to get the look I wanted, but I want to try to keep my code clean as much as possible. I don't know if I accomplished that but I did my best. 

If you are reading this I really hope you check out the recipes, because my family really does like them. I choose a monospace font because that was the font used in most of my childhood recipes. Will I revisit this? perhaps, when I get deeper into understanding CSS and JS. I think I will truly have to understand CSS to avoid inline CSS.
